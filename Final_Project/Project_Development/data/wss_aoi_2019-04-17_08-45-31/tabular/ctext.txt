Cracks up to 1 inch wide open to a depth of 10 to 24 inches or more in most years. COLE ranges from about 0.1 to 0.2 throughout the Bssg and Bkssg horizons Depth to free carbonates ranges from 20 to more than 60 inches. Depth to layers with n-value greater than 0.7 ranges from 60 to more than 80 inches.

The A or Ap horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 2 to 4, and chroma of 1 or 2. Texture is clay, silty clay, or silty clay loam. A surface mantle of recent overwash material that is stratified fine sand, loamy fine sand, sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or silt loam up to 12 inches thick is on some pedons near crevasse splays. The overwash material has the same range in colors as the A horizon and also includes dark brown (10YR 4/3) and brown (10YR 5/3). Some pedons have a clayey buried A horizon below a depth of 20 inches. Reaction in the A horizon ranges from moderately acid to moderately alkaline.

The Bg horizon has hue of 10YR through 2 5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 or less; or value of 6 and chroma of 2; or hue of 5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 or less. Iron accumulations in shades of brown, yellow, or red are few to many. Texture is silty clay or clay. Average clay content in the Bg horizon ranges from 40 to about 90 percent. Reaction ranges from moderately acid to moderately alkaline.

The Bssg horizon has hue of 10YR through 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, chroma of 1 or less; or value of 6 and chroma of 2; or hue of 5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 or less. Iron accumulations in shades of brown, yellow, or red are few to many. Texture is dominantly clay, however subhorizons with texture of silty clay are in many pedons. Some pedons have thin lenses or strata of silty clay loam or silt loam, or clay with hue of 5YR or redder in the Bssg horizon. Average clay content in the Bssg horizon ranges from 60 to about 90 percent. Reaction ranges from strongly acid to moderately alkaline.

Some pedons have a Bkssg horizon that contains up to 20 percent soft masses of calcium carbonate. Where present, it has color and texture ranges similar to that of the Bssg horizon. Reaction ranges from neutral to moderately alkaline.

The BCg and Cg horizons, where present, have hue of 10YR through 5GY, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 or less. Iron accumulations in shades of brown, yellow, or red are few to common. Texture typically is clay or silty clay but in some pedons it is silt loam or silty clay loam below a depth of 40 inches. In some pedons, the Cg horizon has an n-value of 0.7 or more below a depth of 60 inches. Reaction ranges from neutral to moderately alkaline."|"16451281"|"16178012"
