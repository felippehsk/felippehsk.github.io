Soils in this MLRA map unit formed in fine-silty sediments on delta plains on natural levee positions in the lower Mississippi River Alluvial Plain, known as MLRA 131A. Slopes are generally around 0.5 percent, but range from 0 to 1 percent. The soils in this unit do not flood or pond. A typical profile of Cancienne silt loam is as follows:

Ap: 0 to 58 centimeters  silt loam
Bg: 58 to 170 centimeters  silty clay loam, silt loam, loam
BCg: 170 to 203 centimeters  silty clay loam, silt loam, loam

This entire map unit is within the southern part of Louisiana and south of the hyperthermic line in Assumption, East Baton Rouge, Iberville, Jefferson, Lafourche, Orleans, Plaquemines, St. Bernard, St. Charles, St. James, St. John the Baptist and Terrebonne Parishes. Included with this mapping unit are areas of Carville, Thibaut, Schriever, and Gramercy soils. Carville soils are on similar positions or on younger natural levees and are coarse-silty. Thibaut soils are on the intermediate part of the natural levee and are clayey over loamy, with the depth to the fine-silty material ranging from 51 to 102 centimeters (20 to 40 inches).  Gramercy soils (fine control section) are on lower  positions of the natural levee and are clayey to a depth ranging from 102 to 152 centimeters (40 to 60 inches). Schriever soils (very fine control section) are on lower positions of the natural levee and are clayey to depths of more than 152 centimeters (60 inches). This MLRA map unit is entirely within the 7-DEN MLRA 131A soils area. Most areas of this map unit are cultivated and have been precision land leveled.

The C horizon below that is deformable but not fluid to beyond 80 inches.  Across the road from this site is an area of essentially the same soil that has not been crowned and is slightly wetter.  The discussion here was whether these two areas should be mapped as the same map unit, and it was decided that they should be to avoid having squared off units that would be highly subject to change.  It was decided that surface texture and flood class should be the main criteria for separating map units of this proposed new series.

	Fine textured Schriever like soil -  This site is in a smoothed pasture and is mapped Sharkey clay (Sk) in the out of date survey.  The pedon looked at has a 10YR 3/2 silty clay surface, then a Bssg horizon that is 4/1 and 5/1 clay or silty clay with slickensides to about 50 inches deep.  The C horizon below that is deformable but not fluid to beyond 80 inches.  This looks very similar to the profile looked at in the turtle backed area but it is slightly wetter.  It was suggested that some surface and control section samples should be collected from this site and the turtle backed site to verify that it is going to be in a fine family.  If so, the proposed new Gramercy series will need at least two map units - one with a silty clay loam top and one with a silty clay top.  If a silty clay surface phase is mapped, care must be taken to make sure there is a clean landform break between this soil, and real Scrhiever soils with a clay surface, as they may be hard to tell apart in the field.  Delineations of each should not be intermingled next to one another with no visible landscape differentia."|"610859"|"1586834"

Use and Management

Major Land Uses: Cropland and residential

Cropland

All areas of this soil are prime farmland.

Careful selection and application of chemicals and fertilizers can minimize contamination of ground water.

Clods can form if the soil is tilled when wet.

Compaction can be minimized by controlling traffic.

The rooting depth is restricted by the very high content of clay.

Maintaining or increasing the content of organic matter in the soil helps to prevent crusting, improves tilth, and increases the rate of water infiltration.

A subsurface drainage system can help to lower the seasonal high water table. 

The movement of water into the subsurface drains, however, is restricted. Drainage guides can be used to determine the spacing requirements for tile.

Including deep-rooted cover crops in the rotation improves soil structure and provides pathways in the clayey subsoil, thereby facilitating the movement of water into subsurface drains.

Pastureland

Excess water should be removed, or species of grasses or legumes that are adapted to wet soil conditions should be grown.

Compaction can be minimized by restricting grazing during wet periods.

Forestland

The seasonal high water table can restrict root respiration, thereby inhibiting the growth of some species of seedlings.

Because of the low strength of the soil, ruts may form, resulting in unsafe conditions and damage to equipment

Wetness in the soil can limit the use of logging trucks.

Because of the content of clay, this soil becomes sticky when wet. The stickiness increases the cost of constructing haul roads and log landings, reduces the efficiency of mechanical planting equipment, and restricts the use of equipment for site preparation to the drier periods.

Building Sites

This soil is generally unsuited to building site development. It is subject to rare flooding under unusual weather conditions. The flooding can result in physical damage and costly repairs to buildings. Special design of structures, including farm outbuildings, may be needed to avoid the damage.

In some areas, the high content of clay in the subsoil increases the difficulty of digging, filling, and compacting the soil material in shallow excavations.

Septic Tank Absorption Fields

Because of the seasonal high water table, this soil is generally unsuitable as a site for septic tank absorption fields.

Flooding, on rare occasions, limits the absorption and proper treatment of effluent from septic systems.

Rapidly moving floodwater can damage some components of septic systems.

Local Roads and streets

Because of shrinking and swelling, this soil may not be suitable as base material for local roads and streets.

The seasonal high water table affects the ease of excavation and grading and limits the load-bearing capacity of the soil.

Roads and bridges need special design to avoid the damage caused by flooding.
